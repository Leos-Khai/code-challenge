I need help writing a technical specification document for a live scoreboard system I've designed. Here's my solution approach:

The Problem:
We need a live scoreboard showing top 10 users with real-time updates. Users complete actions that increase their scores, and we need to prevent cheating/unauthorized score manipulation.

Design:

I'm thinking of using an action token system for security:
- Before a user performs an action, they request a token from the server
- The token is a JWT that includes the user ID, action type, expected score value, and a unique nonce
- Token expires after 5-15 minutes
- When they complete the action, they send the token back
- Server validates the token, checks it hasn't been used before, then updates the score
- Each token can only be used once

For the architecture, I want:
- Node.js/Express REST API for HTTP endpoints
- WebSocket (Socket.io or ws) for real-time updates
- PostgreSQL as the main database
- Redis for caching the leaderboard and pub/sub for broadcasting updates
- JWT authentication for users

API endpoints would be:
- GET /api/leaderboard - get top 10
- POST /api/actions/start - request an action token
- POST /api/actions/complete - submit completed action with token

For real-time updates, WebSocket connections would:
- Require authentication with JWT
- Broadcast leaderboard updates when top 10 changes
- Send personal score updates to individual users

I also want rate limiting, audit logging of all score changes, and Redis sorted sets for fast leaderboard queries.

Can you help me write this up as a comprehensive technical specification document? Include:
1. Full documentation in README.md format
2. References to PlantUML diagrams for architecture, score flow, and security flow
3. Database schema for users, action_tokens, and score_history tables
4. WebSocket protocol details
5. Error handling
6. Scalability and improvement suggestions
7. Implementation checklist

Make it production-ready and detailed enough for a backend team to implement."
